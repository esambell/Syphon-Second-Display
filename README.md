QC Container App
================

Simple Cocoa Application for bundling a Quartz Composition.  Compatible with Xcode 5.


Bundle your Quartz Composition into an application in three easy steps:

1. Add your Quartz Composition file to the Project. (Opt-Cmd-A)
2. Replace _FILENAME_ on AppDelegate.m, line 28 with the name of your Quartz Composition file without the extension. Example: if the filename was MyTestComposition.qtz, then you would replace _FILENAME_ with _MyTestComposition_
3. Compile and run
