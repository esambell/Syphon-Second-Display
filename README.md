Syphon Second Display
================

A simple app to direct a Syphon output through a Quartz Composition and output it to the second monitor. The current composition simply adds a frame delay.<br/>
The output is always forced to a second monitor, if it is disconnected at startup or while running the composition playback is disabled. Upon reconenction it is re-enabled. Adjusting the frame delay requires editing the Quartz Composition directly.<br/>
Could be used to run any Quartz Composition with minor modifications.<br/>
